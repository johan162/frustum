## 🔭 Overview

This program simulates the drainage of water from a **frustum** (truncated cone) shaped bucket through a circular outlet at the bottom center. The simulation uses principles from fluid dynamics to accurately model how the water level decreases over time.

### What is a Frustum?

A frustum is a portion of a cone that lies between two parallel planes cutting it. In this case, it's a bucket with:
- A larger circular opening at the top (radius `r1`)
- A smaller circular base at the bottom (radius `r2`)
- A specific volume capacity (`L` in liters)


## 🔬 Physics Background

### Governing Equations

The simulation is based on the following physical principles:

#### 1. Frustum Volume

The volume of a frustum is given by:

```
V = (π × h / 3) × (r₁² + r₁×r₂ + r₂²)
```

where:
- `V` = volume (m³)
- `h` = height of the frustum (m)
- `r₁` = upper radius (m)
- `r₂` = lower radius (m)

Given the volume `L`, we can solve for the height:

```
h = 3V / (π × (r₁² + r₁×r₂ + r₂²))
```

#### 2. Torricelli's Law

**Torricelli's law** states that the speed of efflux of a fluid through a sharp-edged orifice at the bottom of a tank filled to a depth `h` is the same as the speed that a body would acquire in free fall through a height `h`:

```
v = √(2gh)
```

where:
- `v` = velocity of water exiting the outlet (m/s)
- `g` = gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²)
- `h` = height of water above the outlet (m)

#### 3. Volumetric Flow Rate

The volumetric flow rate through the outlet is:

```
Q = A_outlet × v = π(d/2)² × √(2gh)
```

where:
- `Q` = volumetric flow rate (m³/s)
- `A_outlet` = cross-sectional area of the outlet (m²)
- `d` = outlet diameter (m)

#### 4. Rate of Height Change

The rate at which the water level drops depends on the flow rate and the cross-sectional area at the current water height:

```
dh/dt = -Q / A(h)
```

where:
- `A(h)` = cross-sectional area at height `h` (m²)
- The negative sign indicates the water level is decreasing

For a frustum, the radius at height `h` is:

```
r(h) = r₂ + (r₁ - r₂) × (h / H)
```

And the cross-sectional area is:

```
A(h) = π × r(h)²
```

#### 5. Realistic Flow Corrections

##### Discharge Coefficient (Cd)
Real orifices don't achieve ideal flow due to:
- **Vena contracta**: Flow stream contracts after leaving the orifice
- **Edge effects**: Sharp edges create turbulence and energy losses
- **Viscous losses**: Fluid friction reduces flow rate

Typical Cd values:
```
Cd = 1.0   → Ideal flow (theoretical only)
Cd = 0.8   → Smooth, rounded orifice
Cd = 0.65  → Typical sharp-edged orifice
Cd = 0.6   → Sharp edge with significant contraction
```

The corrected velocity becomes:
```
v = Cd × √(2gh)
```

##### Viscosity Correction
Flow behavior depends on the **Reynolds number** (Re):

```
Re = v × d / ν
```

where `ν` is kinematic viscosity (m²/s).

Flow regimes:
- **Laminar (Re < 2300)**: Smooth, ordered flow with significant viscous effects
- **Transitional (2300 < Re < 4000)**: Mixed regime
- **Turbulent (Re > 4000)**: Chaotic flow with reduced viscous effects

Viscosity correction factors:
```
Re < 2300:  factor = 0.70  (70% of ideal)
Re < 4000:  factor = 0.85  (85% of ideal)
Re > 4000:  factor ≈ 1.0   (minimal viscosity effect)
```

#### 6. Numerical Integration

We solve the differential equation using **Euler's method**:

```
h(t + Δt) = h(t) + (dh/dt) × Δt
```

This is repeated for each time step `Δt` until the bucket is empty.

The program will then display a graph showing:
- Water height (m) on the y-axis
- Time (seconds) on the x-axis
- A smooth curve showing the drainage process
- Parameter information in a text box
- Grid lines for easy reading

### Understanding the Graph

The drainage curve is **non-linear** because:
1. As water level decreases, the flow rate decreases (√h relationship)
2. The cross-sectional area changes with height (frustum shape)
3. Both effects combine to create a characteristic drainage curve

The curve typically shows:
- **Fast drainage initially** when the water level is high (higher pressure)
- **Slower drainage at the end** as the water level approaches zero

## 🧪 Testing the Simulator

### Test Case 1: Small Bucket with Small Outlet

```
r1 = 0.10 m
r2 = 0.05 m
L  = 5 liters
d  = 0.005 m
t  = 0.01 s

Expected: Several hundred seconds
```

### Test Case 2: Large Bucket with Large Outlet

```
r1 = 0.30 m
r2 = 0.20 m
L  = 50 liters
d  = 0.02 m
t  = 0.05 s

Expected: A few hundred seconds (faster due to larger outlet)
```

### Test Case 3: Cylindrical Approximation

```
r1 = 0.15 m
r2 = 0.15 m  (same as r1, approaches cylinder)
L  = 20 liters
d  = 0.01 m
t  = 0.05 s
```

**Note**: The program requires r1 > r2, so this won't work as-is. Use r2 = 0.149 m for near-cylindrical behavior.

## 📝 Physics Assumptions

This simulation makes the following ideal assumptions:

1. **No air resistance**: Air drag is negligible
2. **Sharp-edged orifice**: The outlet is a perfect circular hole
3. **Steady flow**: No turbulence or vortex formation
4. **Rigid container**: The bucket doesn't deform
5. **Constant gravity**: g = 9.81 m/s²

In reality:
- Surface tension and vortex effects may play a role
